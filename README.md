# Projects

Trying my hand at making a clone of conways game of life


# Issues

It's currently broken as im trying to optimise and get it working with lenia.

Lenia is a more continuous version of conways game of life.

# TODO

 - [ ] Add Tests
 - [ ] add a more modular way of drawing the window, i.e. grid size and cell size are proportional regardless of change
 - [ ] change padding for drawing individual cells
 - [ ] change from discrete enum to floats for lenia
